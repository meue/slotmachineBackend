# Hi!
This is a minimal pseudo backend for a slotmachine and is the result of a application-test as a java-developer. (Yes, it was a success)
It includes Java, Spring, JUnit, Maven and Json.

## build it
`mvn clean install`

`mvn package`


# test it
`mvn test`

# run it
in Terminal:
`java -jar target/slotmachineBackend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

Open this in browser: 
`http://localhost:8082/spin`

(I used port 8082 to avoid conflicts with other webservices you might have running)
